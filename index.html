                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>Hello, my name is Ethan Proffitt and I’m a senior at Virginia Tech. I love the idea of the "VT-Shaped" student given the proper application; and the profession I am working toward is certainly one of those applications. However, like any other angle on student development, it has its flaws.</p>

							<h3>My Goals</h3>
							<p>I aspire to become a Professional Writer after graduating from Virginia Tech. The "VT-Shaped" model of deep specialty knowledge, paired with a broad interdisiplinary education, and an emphasis on technology and strong community connections will certainly serve me well as I move into a professional career. My identity regard this model has evolved since I was first introduced to it; and it is now my pleasure to demonstrate how this has come about, and the critiques I now have for the model. </p>

                            <a ID="reflections"><h3>Reflections on the "VT-Shaped" Student</h3></a>
							<p>Personally, I am a big proponent of the “VT-Shaped” student development model. I feel like it is a product of a wealth of education experience and research, and will serve current and future students well. I also believe it can be a very effective tool to help set Virginia Tech apart from other universities. Plenty of other Universities use the “T-shaped” model, but Virginia Tech has added the all-important “V” portion to that model. While this is a clever play on the University’s initials that will help in “sticking” in a student (or prospective student’s) mind; it’s also vital to the overall model because it incorporates an adaptation to current technological standards, and a puts a strong value on community service and connections. I am confident in the potential that the “VT-shaped” student has, but I also recognize that a “one-size-fits-all” mentality is not an effective one. That is why it is my hope that all of you will continue to sculpt and evolve this model for each college, department, major, and even each student at Virginia Tech.</p>
                            <p>The app I have designed helps the student to conduct something of a "self-service" regarding whether or not their current status regarding the "VT-Shaped" student model is best for them given the field of work they are pursuing/interested in. It also provides that suggestion that perhaps the "VT-Shaped" model is not the best for them, and perhaps they should consider another model, like the "well-rounded" model. This is also the issue that the majority of my essay will regard. The essay and design can be found via the navigation bar at the top of this page.
