                            <h3>My App Design</h3>
                            <h4>Introduction</h4>
							<p>For my final project design, I have created a prototype of an app using a program called Balsamiq. My app is called MyVTShape, and its primary goal is to assist students in understanding what form of the “VT-shaped” model is best for them, given a selected career. This helps give students more personal autonomy in deciding how they want to craft their education at Virginia Tech, while also remaining within the guidelines of the “VT-Shaped” development model. Additionally, adding an interactive visualization of the “VT-shaped” model that reacts to a student’s decisions or possible decisions will help them understand, target, and realize their goals. It allows students to view the ideal “VT-Shaped” form of a given career, and compare it side-by-side to their current “VT-shape.” Then it gives them suggestions on how to meet that ideal form for the career they chose. They can also set different profiles, with different academic choices and pathways set for each. That way, if a student wonders what their “VT-Shape” would like if they took certain classes or completed the coursework for a different major. I believe this app will help students have a clear understanding that the “VT-Shaped” model is not a “one size fits all” approach (or at least that it shouldn’t be). It will help them understand that the “VT-Shaped” model is great, but it takes many different forms; and the better they can hone their “shape,” the better their education will serve them.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Walkthrough</h4>
                            <p>When the app is opened, the user sees a home screen with a few different options. At the top, there is a combobox that shows a dropdown list of different career options. Once a career is chosen, the large green button below the list that reads “Calculate VTShape” will become clickable. From there they are taken to a screen that displays the ideal “VT-Shape” for that field. On this screen, there are two buttons at the bottom that give the user the option to either calculate another shape, or “cross-reference with your ‘VTShape.’” The “cross-reference” option will take the user to a screen displaying their “VT-Shape” with that of a given profession. It also gives the user suggestions in courses to take in order to better match the shape of the profession. Back on the original calculation page, the user can also click on any of the four parts of the “VT-Shape” to view details about the calculation. This would include why or why not an aspect of the shape is important to the profession. This screen also lists recommended courses for the student if they wish to sharpen their skills in this area.</p>
                            
                            <h4>How it looked for an English major</h4>
                            <p> Since I am pursuing Professional Writing, I used examples from two different areas of professional writing. First, I used Journalism. Upon getting the initial calculation, I click on the “V” and “Enhanced V” portion of the shape. The details for the “V” informed me that Journalists should build community connections, as well as understand that nature and needs of their community. The text below elaborated more on these claims. To help me understand how I might achieve these things, the app recommended the following courses: Issues for Professional/Public Discourse, Intro to Political Science, and Intro to Sociology. Then I click the large “back to calculation” button at the bottom. The “Enhanced V” portion told me that Journalists need to be familiar with technological advancements, and different forms of digital writing, like HTML, word processors, and social media. It went on to explain how this is important because it gives a student flexibility and versatility in a workplace. The courses it recommended were: Writing and Digital Media, Intro to Web Design, and Intro to Information Technology. Once I was finished browsing each section of the shape, I compared it with my own. I found that my “T” was pretty similar to the “T” for Journalism, but my “V” was lacking in comparison. The app suggested that I take more courses involving technology, discourse, and social phenomenon. It also proposed that I get more involved with my community and build connections with those in it. Curious as to how I arrived at the shape I did for myself, I went back to the home screen and selected “view Profile1 VTShape.” There, I got a large view of my shape, with the ability to click on each aspect for more detail, like before. When I click on my “Horizontal T,” I got a list of courses that I had taken that got me to the point I was at in regards to the T. In addition, I got a list of courses that the app recommended I take to further advance my “Horizontal T.”</p>
                            
                            <a ID="judge"><h3>Critical Judgement of the "VT-Shaped" Student</h3></a>
                            <h4>Introduction</h4>
                            <p>Up until this point on my website, I have been very kind to the “VT-Shaped” model of Student Development. However, there are at least two sides to every issue. I believe there is a flaw in the “VT-Shaped” student development model when implemented across a university or a college within a University. I have established that this model works well for me, and most likely for other English majors. This is because of the nature of the careers we will most likely find ourselves in, as I have explained previously. Though I am confident in this model’s ability to guide me to be the student I should be in order to do what I want with my degree; I am not as confident when it is put in the context of other student’s academic paths. While I contend that the “VT-Shaped” student model is an excellent one for me and overall; I also recognize that it does not fit as well for other students taking different academic and career trajectories.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Example: Business Major</h4>
                            <p>A student that is studying Business with hopes of starting his or her own company may not find the “VT-Shaped” student very useful. Specifically, the student may find his/herself at a disadvantage if they when through their time at Virginia Tech studying only the nature of business deeply, and studying everything else in a far more broad and vague manner. This combination of a strong grasp on one subject, and only an awareness-level understanding of everything else is the perfect template for a “T-Shaped” student. It is my contention that a prospective business owner will need to have far more of an understanding of things like: communication, advertising, sociology and psychology than just an entry-level introduction that a “T-Shaped” model provides. Depending on the business in which the student plans to go into, they may need a wealth of different subjects to be familiar with in order to construct a successful business. In most cases, to adequately supply the student in this example with both the appropriate depth and breadth of knowledge they need in four years, a “well-rounded” approach would be superior to a “T-shaped” model.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Example: Engineering Major</h4>
                            <p>While I’ve stated that English is a gateway to many different career paths, other departments on campus cannot say this. Many are much more pointed and directed at a specific occupation or handful of occupations. Engineering is one of these fields. Simply put, an Engineer does not need to “build community connections.” An Engineer will stay in their workspace, and conduct their task. They tend not to interact with people “on the streets” like a Journalist or Business person does. In short, they have little need for a “V.” The time spent creating their “V” could be better spent honing craft; as to be able to move up in the highly competitive workforce that Engineering is. One moves up in this field by being able to accomplish things within their subset of Engineering more efficiently, effectively, and even innovatively than others. This is not accomplished by doing charity work and community service. So perhaps the University should take a closer look at the implementation of this model in Engineering, particularly given the fact that it is the largest College we have. I believe a more “extended T-Shaped” model would be better suited for Engineers, rather than the “VT-Shaped” model.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>I still firmly believe that the “VT-Shaped” student model is an excellent one, given the proper application. Liberal Arts, particularly English is most certainly one of these fields. However, as I have demonstrated, there are at least some settings where this model is less effective. Some students need more or less of certain aspects of the model; and some would be better suited to try a different approach or leave certain aspects of this approach behind. While every other student development model also has flaws, I believe the flaws in the “VT-Shaped” model are minimal, but significant enough that they should be carefully examined and remedied. </p>
