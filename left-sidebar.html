                            <a ID="podcastessay"><h3>Essay on the "T-Shaped" Student Model</h3></a>
							<p>I truly believe that the “T-shaped” model is the most beneficial and efficient model of student development. While there are others, such as the “well-rounded” student, the “T-shaped” model is superior because it provides students with a strong, deep knowledge of their specialty field, along with a broad understanding of other fields. This can help set one student apart from others, given the versatile yet structurally sound nature of their education. My design essay will be more targeted at the negative aspects of the model, but this essay to accompany my podcast will be more pointed at the affirmation of the “T-shaped” model’s superiority.</p>
                            
	                       <p>As I considered all the different ways in which a professional writer might find employment, I found one common thread in all of these: they must be master communicators. Whether they are communicating in an explanatory way, such as a Technical Writer would, or in the form of a presentation, like a Business Writer may, or in a persuasive manner, like that of a Journalist, they all must have the ability to communicate effectively. This means speaking to different people on different subjects. Rarely will a writer find themselves writing about the same things to the same people for the entirety of their career. Therefore, they must be aware and comfortable will different people and subject matters. This is why the “T-shaped” model is crucial for a Professional Writer. It gives the English student a deep understanding of how to communicate through writing, in all of its different mediums; but also introduces different topics and issues that a student will encounter later on as they move through a workforce. Whether the variable they encounter is a new set of jargon, people of different cultures, or simply a subject matter that they are not familiar with; the “T-Shaped” model can help introduce them to these variables before they encounter them.</p>
                            
	                       <p>Fortunately for me, I’m confident in my own “T-shape” here at Virginia Tech. Primarily, the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences and the Department of English have been spectacular in promoting the “T-shaped” student. Of course, the English courses are great, and my professors have been wonderful in helping me achieve a much deeper knowledge of English than I anticipated when I arrived in Blacksburg. However, it’s the things outside of the English core curriculum that really sets them apart. For example, I feel that the one thing that grew my “Horizontal T” was my internship at Christiansburg High School. There I sharpened my communication skills by learning how to teach a class of 9th graders. This would not have been possible for me if it were not for the emphasis on community experiences and unique learning opportunities that the Department of English puts on their students.</p>
                            
	                       <p>I greatly enjoyed crafting this podcast, and I hope you enjoyed listening to it. My hope is that I have affirmed your confidence in the “T-shaped” model working in the academic lives of English students who are striving to become Professional Writers. However, if you take a look at my “design” essay (which can be navigated to at the top of this page), you’ll see a different position I hold for the “VT-Shaped” student model.</p>
